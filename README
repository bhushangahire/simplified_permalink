= Simplified Permalink

I know there are some plugins out there that do the same, but this one 
fits my needs.

== Example

Add to your posts the permalink attribute.

    add_column :posts, :permalink, :null => false
    add_index :posts, :permalink

And use it on your controllers.


    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      permalink :title
    end

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      permalink :title, :slug
    end
